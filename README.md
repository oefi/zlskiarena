| Persona | Snow | Temp | Sun | Wind |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🎿 Universal | 35% | 25% | 25% | 15% |
| ❄️ Powder | 55% | 25% | 10% | 10% |
| ☀️ Sun | 20% | 20% | 50% | 10% |
| 👨‍👩‍👧 Family | 25% | 30% | 35% | 10% |

## Data

Baked data: Open-Meteo ERA5-Land reanalysis · Dec 10 → Apr 10 · 6 complete seasons.  
Current season (2025/26): fetched live from `archive-api.open-meteo.com` on page load.

> **Note:** Data in this repo is currently **synthetic** (generated from published climate norms for development). Run `scripts/fetch_openmeteo.py` to replace with real ERA5-Land data, then rebuild.

## Rebuild

```bash
# Generate synthetic data (development)
python3 scripts/generate_synthetic.py

# Or fetch real Open-Meteo data
pip install requests
python3 scripts/fetch_openmeteo.py

# Process
python3 scripts/clean_normalize.py
python3 scripts/compute_metrics.py

# Build single-file dashboard
python3 build_dashboard.py
# → nauders_dashboard.html  (~2.9 MB)
```

## Caveats

- ERA5-Land is model reanalysis, not station observations. Micro-valley effects may be missed.
- 6 seasons is recent history, not long-term climatology.
- Snowmaking coverage is not reflected in model data.
- Ski 6 surcharge applies at Sulden and Trafoi.
